# coffectionary
Coffectionary is my first iOS app built using SwiftUI. It is an app I made for learning purposes only. Hence it is similar to what Apple offers as the official SwiftUI Documentation.

Coffectionary is a coffee dictionary built as an iOS/iPad OS application. It includes all different types of coffees along with their recipes and approximate caffeine levels. All the data are stored in JSON format locally and are accessed in a presentable manner using SwiftUI. It offers features like searching for a faster index or bookmarking locally using the Observable Object model.
